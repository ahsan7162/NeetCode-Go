# Problem: Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a valid binary search tree (BST).



A binary tree is a valid BST if for every node:



* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees are valid BSTs..

## Constraints:



* -10^4 < Node.data < 10^4
* The tree contains nodes in the range \[1, 500].
