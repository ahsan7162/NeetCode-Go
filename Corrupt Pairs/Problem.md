# Corrupt Pairs

Statement
We are given an unsorted array, nums, with n
 elements and each element is in the range [1,n] inclusive. The array originally contained all the elements from 1ton but due to a data error, one of the numbers is duplicated, which causes another number missing. Find and return the corrupt pair (missing, duplicated).

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3 

1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ n
